Codeine is a platform for coders to learn new languages or polish their coding skills. Codeine takes a gamified approach to the organization and delivery content to enhance the learning experience. Codeine also supports the deployment of personal integrated coding environments for our users to access from anywhere, removing the hassle of having to set up local machines. Codeine is developed under the NUS School of Computing IS4103 Information Systems Capstone Project under the advisory of Prof Lek Hsiang Hui.

Codeine-react's aim is to support the frontend operations, and is jointly developed by:
